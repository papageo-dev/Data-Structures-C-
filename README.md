# Data Structures (C)

Some work, in C programming language, on the "Data Structures" course,
at Department of Applied Informatics, University of Macedonia.

# Code Information

The code were created using "Code :: Blocks IDE" and I used "GNU Compiler for C / C ++".                 
In folder "ADT-Libraries" there are some code files with the "adt-libraries", that are used in exercises.
These libraries are NOT written by me.

# Description

These tasks attempt to explain the use of ready-made data structures to solve simple and more complex problems.

# Folders/Files Information:

Each folder (1_Sets, 2_Stacks etc.) contains the tasks for each type of data structure.
Each folder (a4f11, a2f7, etc.) contains an exercise, with code file(.c), project file(.cbp), executable file(.exe)
and text files(.txt/.dat/.md) from which the program reads or writes(if any).
